  simple run test.py to play.
  
# For windows
  include unicurses.py in the same file as test.py

# For android
  download pydroid, simply copy and paste the raw from test.py into the new file and run (Yellow circle)
  
# For iphone (NOT TESTED)
  find a python interpreter, copy and paste the raw from test.py, run. Again, this isn't tested I don't have an iphone. Full iphone support will come later...
